# cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice; marlin dequantises to FP16 instead.
#
# Pairing marlin with --enforce-eager is recipe convention, not a correctness
# constraint. Marlin's workspace helper reuses storage precisely so a captured
# graph's addresses stay valid, and the only eager gate in this vLLM is for
# DeepseekV4. Capture measures 6 s here. CUDA_GRAPHS=0 restores eager.
#
# Capture sizes are in TOKENS and vLLM rounds them to multiples of (1 + draft
# tokens). Above max_num_seqs * (1 + k) the dispatcher returns NONE and decode
# falls back to eager with nothing in the log to say so, which is why the
# ceiling is computed and checked rather than left to whoever edits the list.
